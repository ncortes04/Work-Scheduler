This project took me many hours to get the code to effectively work. The more i thought i knew what i was doing the more problems i ran into. With reveiw of the previously completed assignments and critical thinking i had started adding code. My plan of attack was to get the current time of day in millitary hours and create an array of 9 that changed the class of the corresponding time block. I chose millitary time becuase it will increase in value up to 24 without an am and pm. I made if statements to check of the value of the hours assigned to the time block is greater, less than, or equal to the current time. These parameters determined which class would be added to the elements. I then created additional arrays that grabbed the element by id and created an array to store text content within the timeblocks. These were ran in a for loop to prevent repetition of code. I then created a function that ran through local storage and grabbed the text content to add to the page. I have added comments in the source code that goes more into depth on how the code communicates with another. I am very satisfied that my original plan worked.
